Visualization
===============
This class visualizes the population growing and migrating over the island. A map over the island used for the simulation
gets plotted up topp to the left, in the middle the current year plotted is displayed and to the right the total population
of herbivores and carnivores is displayed in a graph. In the middle there are two heatmaps which each display herbivores
and carnivores moving over the island. On the bottom three bar charts showing the fitness, age and weight for both
all herbivores and all carnivores.

At the end of a run, a mp4 is saved under reference_examples/results of the simulation.
