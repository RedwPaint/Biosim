# BioSim 2023

BioSim runs a simulation of an island with herbivores and carnivores. The island consist of 4 different terrain (water, desert, lowland, highland) where 
the amount of fodder differ between different terrains. Animals can not move to water, so the outer ring of the island map must consist of water to 
keep the animals on the island.
